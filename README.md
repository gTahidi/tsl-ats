## License

This project is licensed under GNU GPLv3.

### Why GPL?

The whole point of this project is that there's so many ATS platforms out there that are either 
too expensive, too complicated, or too restrictive. This project aims to be a simple, open-source alternative 
that can be self-hosted and customized to your needs.

For that reason, I've chosen the GNU GPLv3 license to ensure that any modifications or improvements made to this project
are shared back with the community. This is to prevent any one entity from taking the project and making it proprietary.
